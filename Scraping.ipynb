No other revenue figures appear in the slides. \\n\\nThe user seems to need this for precise data extraction - perhaps for comparative analysis or reporting. Since they emphasized \"exact value,\" I\\'ll omit the growth percentage and footnotes in the response. \\n\\nFinal check: The $27.4B is consistent throughout the document (e.g., repeated in the Consumer Payment Spend section).

That seems like the primary data point. \\n\\nI double-check for any caveats. The superscripts indicate notes: \"1\" for revenue (net of interest expense) and \"2\" for EPS, but net income has no superscript, meaning it\\'s likely presented as-is without special adjustments. \\n\\nNo other net income figures appear in the Consumer Banking or Global Markets sections. The $7.4B is consistent across the summary, and the YoY growth percentage reinforces it\\'s a key metric. \\n\\nThe user emphasized \"exact value only,\" so I\\'ll ignore the percentage growth and any contextual analysis.
