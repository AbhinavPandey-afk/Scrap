Scanning the provided data, I spot the \"Revenue $27.4B1\" under the 1Q25 Highlights section. The superscript 1 indicates it\\'s net of interest expense, which aligns with footnote 1\\'s definition. \\n\\nHmm, I should verify if there\\'s any ambiguity. The document also mentions net income ($7.4B) and EPS figures, but those are distinct from revenue. The growth metrics (+6% YoY) further confirm this is the revenue line item. No other revenue figures appear in the slides. \\n\\nThe user seems to need this for precise data extraction - perhaps for comparative analysis or reporting. Since they emphasized \"exact value,\" I\\'ll omit the growth percentage and footnotes in the response. \\n\\nFinal check: The $27.4B is consistent throughout the document (e.g., repeated in the Consumer Payment Spend section).

I start scanning the provided context. \\n\\nIn the \"1Q25 Highlights\" section on slide 2, I see a clear breakdown: Revenue is $27.4B, and right below it is Net income at $7.4B with a \"+11% YoY\" notation. That seems like the primary data point. \\n\\nI double-check for any caveats. The superscripts indicate notes: \"1\" for revenue (net of interest expense) and \"2\" for EPS, but net income has no superscript, meaning it\\'s likely presented as-is without special adjustments. \\n\\nNo other net income figures appear in the Consumer Banking or Global Markets sections. The $7.4B is consistent across the summary, and the YoY growth percentage reinforces it\\'s a key metric. \\n\\nThe user emphasized \"exact value only,\" so I\\'ll ignore the percentage growth and any contextual analysis. Just the number: $7.4B. \\n\\nFinal confirmation: No conflicting data in later slides about net income.
